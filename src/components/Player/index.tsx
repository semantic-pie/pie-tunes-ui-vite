I've got a river running right into you
I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do
A taste of the divine

You've got my body, flesh and bone, yeah
The sky above, the Earth below
Raise me up again
Take me past the edge

I want to see the other side
See the other side
You've got my body, flesh and bone
The sky above, the Earth below

Raise me up again
Take me past the edge
I want to see the other side
Won't you show me what it's like?
Won't you show me what it's like?

Oh, and my love
Did I mistake you for a sign from God?
Or are you really here to cut me off?
Or maybe just to turn me on
'Cause these days

I would be lying if I told you that
I didn't wish that I could be your man
Or maybe make a good girl bad
I've got a river running right into you

I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do

The taste of the divine
You've got my body, flesh and bone
The sky above, the Earth below
Nothing to say and nowhere to go
A taste of the divine
